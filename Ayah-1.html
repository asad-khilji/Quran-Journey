        <h2 class="sub-heading">Hamd</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Hamd means praise and thanks. Praise and thanks are two separate ideas. You could thank without praising and you could praise without thanking. For example, Ibrahim thanks his father for raising him, but he does not praise the worship of idols he builds. Musa thanks the Pharoah for raising him, but he does not praise him as a god. When saying Alhamdulillah, we must have two attitudes in mind, praise and thanks. We cannot complain after saying Alhamdulillah. We must find a genuine reason to praise and thank Allah. Our deen begins with optimism and a positive attitude. This is a complete change in thought and attitude. Hamd means praise and thanks that is genuine and sincere. Shukr means thanks but it is not genuine or sincere thanks. Gratitude and thanks is limited to a reaction. Hamd is praise and thanks that is not limited to a reaction.</p>
