        <h2 class="sub-heading-1">ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ</h2>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Hamd</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Hamd means praise and thanks. Praise and thanks are two separate ideas. You could thank without praising and you could praise without thanking. For example, Ibrahim thanks his father for raising him, but he does not praise the worship of idols he builds. Musa thanks the Pharoah for raising him, but he does not praise him as a god. When saying Alhamdulillah, we must have two attitudes in mind, praise and thanks. We cannot complain after saying Alhamdulillah. We must find a genuine reason to praise and thank Allah. Our deen begins with optimism and a positive attitude. This is a complete change in thought and attitude. Hamd means praise and thanks that is genuine and sincere. Shukr means thanks but it is not genuine or sincere thanks. Gratitude and thanks is limited to a reaction. Hamd is praise and thanks that is not limited to a reaction.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Nouns and Verbs</h2>
        <p class="post-text">There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Nouns do not require anyone or anything to do an action. Nouns are independent and not stuck in time. Nouns are timeless and permanent. Verbs require someone or something to do an action. Verbs are dependent on someone or something. Verbs are stuck in time either in the past, present, or future tense. Verbs are temporary. The word Hamd is a noun so it is timeless and independent from everyone and everything. The Praise and Thanks for Allah is timeless and permanent. Allah does not need anyone to praise or thank Him. Whether we praise or thank Allah or not the praise and thanks of Allah still exists.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Two Kinds of Sentences</h2>
        <p class="post-text">There are two kinds of sentences. Sentences whose purpose is information and sentences whose purpose is emotion. Allah said Alhamdulillah, or Praise and Thanks is for Allah, so it is a sentence of information and emotion. If Allah had said innal Alhamdulillah, or Praise and Thanks is only for Allah, then it would have been a sentence of information only. </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Surah Al Fatihah and Surah Al Jathiya</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Surah Al Fatihah says Praise and Thanks is for Allah. Surah Al Jathiya says Praise and Thanks is only for Allah. Praise and thanks is only for Allah is used when arguing with people. Surah Al Fatihah is a statement from the heart and we already know who Allah is. Surah Al Fatihah is not arguing with anyone. In Surah Al Jathiya Allah is debating with the polytheist so Praise and Thanks is only for Allah is used. When saying Praise and Thanks is only for Allah, it is also saying Hamd is not for anyone else</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Name of Allah</h2>
        <p class="post-text">When we call Allah by His name than we appreciate all the qualities of Allah. We can praise Allah with one word and include all His attributes by using the name Allah. Allah is the proper name of Allah. Names are very important in an introduction. Allah introduces Himself to us in the Fatihah so He uses His name. By Allah introducing to us with His name it clears any confusion of Praise or thanks being for anyone else.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Ultimate Praise and Thanks</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Praise and Thanks could be for other people and things, but ultimately Praise and Thanks goes back to Allah. The Ultimate, Genuine, Sincere, & Timeless Priase and Thanks is for Allah who is independent from His creation</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Rabb</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The name Rabb consists of four other names Malik, Sayyed, Murrabi, Qayyim, and Munnim. Malik means Master or owner. Sayyed is the one who is in control and in charge. Murrabi is the one who is improving us constantly, and the one who allows us to grow and develop. Qayyim is the one who sustains us and takes care of us constantly. Munnim is the one who gives us gifts over and over again. Everything Allah gives us is a gift and when you receive a gift you cannot complain.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">The Master and Slave Relationship</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Allah is our Master and we are His Slaves. Human beings have a negative connation of slavery. Allah is a unique Master. Human beings have this delusion that they are free. There is no such thing as freedom. We are enslaved to someone or something like money, fashion, government, employers, etc. When you enslave yourself to Allah then you are free from all other forms of slavery.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Alameen</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Alameen refers to all kinds of nations and people. Those nations and people from every generation and every culture in every time and every place.</p>
